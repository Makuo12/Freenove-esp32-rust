# Freenove ESP32 Tutorials in Rust 🦀

Welcome to an exciting journey into embedded programming with Rust! This project reimagines the popular Freenove Ultimate Kit tutorials through the lens of Rust programming, bringing you the power of memory safety and zero-cost abstractions to microcontroller development.

## About

We're transforming the traditional C and MicroPython-based Freenove lessons into idiomatic Rust code. Whether you're an embedded systems veteran or just starting out, these tutorials will help you master both Rust and hardware programming through hands-on projects.
