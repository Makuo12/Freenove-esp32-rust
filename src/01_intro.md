# Introduction

## Content of this material

The goal of this material is to provide step by step process to getting through the various chapters from the freenove tutorial book (Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP32) using the Rust programming language. The approach we would b taking is `no_std` (bare metal). To better understand this approach, see [Developing on Bare Metal (no_std)](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/overview/using-the-core-library.html) and [The Rust on ESP Book](https://docs.esp-rs.org/no_std-training/).

This book also draws inspiration from The Rust on ESP Book and no_std training rust books.

If you would like to learn about `std` development, see [Using the Standard Library (std)] chapter of [The Rust on ESP Book] and,
[Embedded Rust on Espressif] training.

For any technical inquiries or difficulties, please join the [esp-rs community](https://matrix.to/#/#esp-rs:matrix.org) on Matrix. Any problems I have, I usually just post them in the chat, and I always receive a response.

## The board

The board I will be using is the ESP32, but all ESP boards will work fine.

## The Freenove materials

The materials folder contains the Freenove tutorial materials, which are available in Python and C. These items would be used as references for what will be covered in the book.
To ensure that you have all the items you will need, you can order a comprehensive toolkit.

## Rust knowledge

- Basic Rust like [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) Chapters 1 - 6, Chapter 4 Ownership, does not need to be fully understood.
- [The Rust on ESP Book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/) is not required, but it is highly recommended, as it can help you understand the Rust on ESP ecosystem and many of the concepts that will be discussed during the training.
